# Commit Etiquette

From https://stories.devacademy.la/how-to-use-github-like-a-proper-human-being-1a9c895c4e13:

    Keep your commits atomic. 
    What’s this mean? Fresh Consulting says that you should apply changes as you make them.
    Your commit should revolve around ONE change or fix. 
    If you have to add an “and” in your commit message, you’ve already committed too much.
    
    Keep your commit message under 50 characters. Why? Shorter things are easier to read, like this sentence. 
    Capitalize the first word your commit message. 
    This is seen as generally good conduct by most gitsperts. 
    Sentence case is also more professional looking and easier to read. (See a pattern here?)
    
    Don’t end your commit message with a period. Leave people in suspense. Leave them wanting more. 
    Also, you want to make sure your 50 characters are well spent.
   
   Use an imperative commit message. Make your commits sound like you gave a command to someone. 
   Programming is normally defined as “ordering your computer to do things”, so might as well keep that reputation up, right?
   
   Use the same language in your commit messages. 
   Most people seem to use English as their preferred language, but it doesn’t mean you have to. 
   What you do have to do is be consistent. Don’t mix phrases in one language with another language.
